        "testimonial": "Chu Lin joined us as an intern for 3 months in May 2024, developing a proof of concept for a platform that could automate contact center operations. I very much enjoyed our time working together. Chu Lin was adaptable, she worked hard, she worked really well independently, and she had a very warm personality that made her a great teammate to be around.\n\nShe took on multiple roles â€“ choosing a stack, developing, writing tests, and working with business users to incorporate feedback on the POC. We all loved what she pushed out on a continuous schedule. The POC worked well. She also did a fabulous job leading demos to various groups of business owners and users, who were sometimes skeptical at the start, but were all impressed by her work thereafter. \n\nI would highly recommend Chu Lin for future roles!",
